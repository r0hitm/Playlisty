                        üî¥ Though, techincally complete, the App is in
                        <i>&quot;development mode&quot;</i>, and I have
                        requested the Spotify team for{" "}
                        <i>&quot;Extended Quota Mode&qouot;</i> which can take
                        upto 6 weeks. As such, anyone whose email account I do
                        not add manually, will not be able to use the app.
                        Let&apos;s wait patiently and hope for the best. ü§û
