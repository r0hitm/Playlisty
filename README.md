# Playlisty

Track your songs across playlists and organize with birdâ€™s eye view.

âš  The App is in `development mode`, and I have requested the Spotify team for `Extended Quota Mode` which can take
upto 6 weeks. As such, anyone whose email account I do not add manually, will not be able to use the app.
Let's wait patiently and hope for the best. ðŸ¤ž

âš  If you want to try the app nonetheless, contact me and I will add your email to the list. **Note**: There is a limit of 25 users, so I might not be able to add everyone.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project and I am not affiliated with Spotify in any way. I saw a need for this tool and built it for my personal use. I am sharing it with the community in the hope that it will be useful to others as well.

## Motivation

I have a lot of playlists on Spotify (including the Liked & some spotify-curated ones). And, I am a guy who likes to keep his music curated, a bit organized and well-structured.
Some of my tracks are in multiple playlists, so you can imagine if I want to move, delete or update a track, I have to do it in multiple places. And, it's a pain. Plus I don't know if I have a track in multiple playlists or not. Because a "Liked" track is in one or more playlists or a track from a playlist is in one or more playlists including "Liked".
With this project, I want to solve this problem and make it easy to see where all my tracks are in a single view, and move them around easily.

## Featuers

- [x] View all tracks across all playlists
- [x] **View the playlists where a track is present or not present at a glance**
- [x] Move tracks between playlists
- [x] Filter tracks by playlist
- [x] Cursor up/down to navigate between songs

## Planned Features (Probably)

Not a priority at the moment:

- Creating new playlist
- Editing playlist details
- Deleting playlist
- Adding new tracks to playlist (via search)
- Mobile Optimized UI
