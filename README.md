# Playlisty

Track your songs across playlists and organize with bird’s eye view.

⚠ **This project is in early development stage.**

## Motivation

I have a lot of playlists on Spotify (including the Liked & some spotify-curated ones). And, I am a guy who likes to keep his music curated, a bit organized and well-structured.
Some of my tracks are in multiple playlists, so you can imagine if I want to move, delete or update a track, I have to do it in multiple places. And, it's a pain. Plus I don't know if I have a track in multiple playlists or not. Because a "Liked" track is in one or more playlists or a track from a playlist is in one or more playlists including "Liked".
With this project, I want to solve this problem and make it easy to see where all my tracks are in a single view, and move them around easily.

## Out of Scope

Currently, I am not prioritizing the following features:

- [ ] Mobile support
- [ ] Creating new playlist
- [ ] Editing playlist details
- [ ] Deleting playlist
- [ ] Adding new tracks to playlist (only moving tracks from one playlist to another)
